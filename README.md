# SenseHat is alive!

Just to get acquainted with [Raspberry-Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) and the [Sense Hat](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/),
I created this [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) look-a-like on the Sense Hat.

I know it's only 8x8 grid, but the Python3 code is adjusted for that. 
Meaning if a cell is generated outside the grid, it is appearing on the other side.

My idea was also to include colors, but because of the small grid, cells and their offsprings will merge into the same color.
