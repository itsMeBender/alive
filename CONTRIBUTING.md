# Contributing

Hi, it's nice if you want to contribute to the source.  

Currently the project is so small, without any goal. 
That it's difficult to say, how you can contribute. The project is started just to code the Raspberry Pi Sense Hat and learning Python3 as we go.

Goal was to implement [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) on a 8x8 grid. Using some sort of color interaction.

I'm not sure how this project will end or will thrive on new ideas. 
I have a lot, but also a lot other other projects and interests.
So, for now this project is as it is. If you want to join or add something to it, please do so. I hope to learn from it.

This project will not be maintained at a certain point. But may-be an other Raspberry Pi enthusiast can use it. Just to test the hardware or see funny things. 

**Some ideas I have:**

* Cells do have a color and when cells are created (birth) they inherit the colors of the parent. It works but the algoritm is not that smart.
* Need some code to recongnize when Life generation is halted of does a flip-flop.
* Integrate other hardware of the Sense hat, like shaking to change the cells.
* ... {add more ideas if you have them} ...
